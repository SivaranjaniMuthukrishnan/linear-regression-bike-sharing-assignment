# Bike Sharing Dataset: Multiple Linear Regression
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available
> for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people
> They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes
> depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes
> in the American market. The company wants to know the following:

> 1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
> 2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

### Business Goal
Create a model to identify the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
